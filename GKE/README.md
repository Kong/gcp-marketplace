Kuma is a service mesh that runs on both Kubernetes and VMs on any cloud. Built on top of Envoy and focused on simplicity, it enables  microservices transformation with out-of-the-box service connectivity and discovery, zero-trust security, traffic reliability and global observability across all traffic including cross-cluster deployments.
